The .vimrc File
---------------

Please refer to the comments in the .vimrc file. I am trying to keep them comprehensive and logical (and sometimes even funny).
In my personal setup(s) I've linked the `$HOME/.vimrc` file to the one in the archive (meaning: `$HOME/.vim/.vimrc`). I advice you to do the same to keep everything nicely bundles in one package.
